# Social Token DEX: Empowering Anonymous Creators with Zama's FHE Technology

Social Token DEX is a cutting-edge decentralized exchange tailored for trading FHE-encrypted social tokens issued by anonymous creators. Utilizing **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**, this platform ensures both the privacy of the creators and their fans while facilitating seamless transactions on the blockchain. 

## Tackling the Challenge of Anonymity

In today’s digital landscape, anonymity is often at odds with visibility, especially for creators in the burgeoning crypto space. Anonymous creators, such as crypto artists and on-chain thinkers, face significant challenges in realizing their economic potential while safeguarding their identities. Traditional platforms can compromise user data and privacy, leaving creators vulnerable to exploitation.

## The Power of FHE: A Game-Changer for Creators

The solution lies in leveraging **Zama's FHE technology**, which allows us to perform operations on encrypted data without ever exposing it. This means that transactions involving social tokens can be conducted without revealing the identities of either the buyers or sellers, thus maintaining confidentiality and integrity. Our implementation relies on Zama's open-source libraries like **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, providing an end-to-end secure experience for all participants in the creator economy.

## Core Functionalities of Social Token DEX

- **FHE-Encrypted Transactions:** All trades are secured through advanced encryption, ensuring the anonymity of both creators and their supporters.
- **Supporting Emerging Creators:** The platform is built for the anonymous creators’ economy, allowing users to explore and invest in social tokens while maintaining privacy.
- **Fan Engagement:** By merging the concepts of fan economies and privacy, we provide a unique environment for fans to engage with and support their favorite creators.
- **Web3 Integration:** The DEX is designed to discover the intrinsic value of Web3 native creators, pushing the boundaries of tokenized interactions.

## Technology Stack

1. **Zama FHE SDK**: Central to our confidential computing capabilities.
2. **Node.js**: For backend development and server-side scripting.
3. **Hardhat/Foundry**: Frameworks for Ethereum smart contract development.
4. **Solidity**: The programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.
5. **Ethereum**: The blockchain network providing the infrastructure for our DEX.

## Directory Structure

Here’s a quick peek at the overall directory layout of the Social Token DEX:

│   └── socialTokenDEX_FHE.sol   # Solidity smart contract for trading social tokens
├── scripts
│   └── deploy.js                 # Deployment scripts for the smart contract
├── test
│   └── socialTokenDEX.test.js    # Test cases for the DEX functionality
├── package.json                   # Project metadata and dependencies
└── README.md                      # Project documentation
```

## Getting Started with Social Token DEX

Assuming you have downloaded the project files, follow these instructions to set up the Social Token DEX on your local environment:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. 
- Install **Hardhat** or **Foundry** based on your preference for smart contract environments.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd socialTokenDEX_FHE
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will fetch all the necessary libraries, including the Zama FHE libraries required for running secure transactions.

## Building and Running the Project

Once you have set up the environment, use the following commands to compile, test, and run your DEX:

1. **Compile the Smart Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the Smart Contract**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

4. **Start the Local Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

## Example Code Snippet

Here's a simple example demonstrating how you might initiate a trade on the Social Token DEX:

```javascript
// scripts/trade.js

async function tradeSocialToken(seller, buyer, tokenAmount) {
    // Call the contract's trading function
    const tokenDEX = await ethers.getContractAt("socialTokenDEX_FHE", contractAddress);
    const tx = await tokenDEX.trade(seller, buyer, tokenAmount);
    await tx.wait();
    console.log(`Trade of ${tokenAmount} social tokens from ${seller} to ${buyer} executed successfully!`);
}
```
